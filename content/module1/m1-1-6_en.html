        <dt>Ali</dt><dd> So Charlene, how do you find  your commute with the new bus route?        </dd>
        <dt>Charlene</dt><dd>It&rsquo;s  a<strong> bit longer</strong>, <strong>but much more</strong> convenient. I'm pretty happy. However, I&rsquo;ll admit I  had some concerns when the change was announced.</dd>
        <dt>Ali</dt><dd>I  think it&rsquo;s <strong>much better</strong>. Now we pass  by some shopping malls on the way home, and we can easily get off the bus to do  our shopping. There is also a sports centre we can go to. Before the change,  there wasn&rsquo;t much to do on the route.</dd>
        <dt>Charlene</dt><dd>Sure, <strong>but on the other hand</strong>, I liked that  the old route went along the river. It was really beautiful and helped me to relax.  In the summer, I could see the plants and trees along the water, and in the  winter, the ice and snow on the trees. Now the drive is less interesting.</dd>
        <dt>Ali</dt><dd>Yes, <strong>but even so</strong>, you can do a lot before  getting home. Everything you need is on the way!</dd>
        <dt>Charlene</dt><dd>Yeah,  but still!</dd>
