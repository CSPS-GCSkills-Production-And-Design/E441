        <h2>CONSUMERS AND LABEL INFORMATION </h2>
        <p>Consumers  in BC appear somewhat more likely to read ingredients lists and nutrition facts  labels, and those in the Atlantic    Provinces are more likely to read diet and health-related  claims. There also appears to be somewhat of a trend among university-educated  consumers to read ingredients lists and nutrition facts tables. Those with  greater than $75,000 in household income are also more likely to read nutrition  facts tables than those with lower incomes.</p>
        <p>More  interestingly, consumers aged 55+ are much more likely to say they read  ingredients labels, nutrition facts and diet and health-related claims to help  make food purchase decisions. This is quite possibly indicative of a greater  need among an aging population to be careful about its diet, especially as more  consumers begin to embrace the linkage between diet and health. Women are also  much more likely to participate in all of these activities than are men.</p>
        <p>Consumers  aged 55 and older and women are also more likely to feel they have control over  what is in the food they buy and to say they are particular about quality and  buy only the best they can afford. They are more likely to say they have  thought about the way their grocery store handles food and to be the main  person responsible for preparing food in the home.</p>
