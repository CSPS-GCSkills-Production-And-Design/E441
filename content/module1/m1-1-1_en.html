<p class="super-special-emphasis">The power to compare</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The power to compare&rdquo; module is intended to help you  better understand what a C-level comparison is so that you can make comparisons  more easily. </p>
  <p>This tool will allow you to use expressions of  comparison and contrast, and to improve your listening and reading comprehension as  well as your ability to express comparisons in writing.</p>
  <p>However, it is suggested that you practise making  comparisons in actual discussions with your colleagues. Feel free to do so by  suggesting discussion topics that will allow you to compare items. </p>
