        <p>To: Nick Milley<br>
        From: Mageli Kagaju</p>
        <p>Hi Nick,</p>
        <p>Since we can&rsquo;t get  together, here is a brief overview of how I expect the workshop to go. </p>
        <p>First, we can divide the  group of participants into sub-groups and ask them to discuss their ideas on  how to make a work team more effective. Then, in a plenary discussion, they  will present the ideas they discussed in their sub-groups. Finally, using a  visual presentation, we can review the important aspects, such as the roles and  responsibilities of the leader and members of an effective team and the differences  between an effective work team and an ineffective work team. </p>
        <p>Here is some information  on the differences between an effective work team and an ineffective work team.  In order to help you prepare the presentation, I found this information in a  document that the Department has used in previous workshops. </p>
       <blockquote>On an effective team, members trust one another and  participation is encouraged,  whereas there is a lack of trust among members of an ineffective team, which breeds mistrust and creates  conflicts. Leadership is shared on an effective  team and objectives are clear. On an ineffective team, the roles and responsibilities are not clear, and  objectives and tasks are not well defined. Finally,  effective teams develop and discuss ideas as a group, and all team  members agree on decisions, whereas on an  ineffective work team, ideas are neither  analysed nor developed, and often, topics other than the matter at hand are discussed.</blockquote>
        <p>Feel free to make  changes to the text if you wish. What&rsquo;s important is that you identify what  makes a work team effective and what makes it ineffective. </p>
        <p>I hope this information  will help you prepare the workshop. </p>
        <p>Talk to you soon!</p>
