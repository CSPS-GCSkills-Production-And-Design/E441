        <h2>A RECORD FOR CANADA</h2>
        
        <p>National Science and Technology  Week saw a lot of science being done across Canada. A record amount of science,  as it turns out. </p>
        <p>Guinness World Records has  confirmed that Canada  has set the world record for the largest practical science lesson at multiple  venues. On October 12, 2012, at 1:00 p.m. EST, two experiments demonstrating  the Bernoulli principle were performed simultaneously at 88 different locations  such as classrooms, science centres and museums across Canada. The experiments involved a  total of 13,701 participants.</p>
        <p>&quot;Congratulations  to all of the participants and organizers for setting this new world  record,&quot; said Canada's  Minister of Natural Resources. &quot;Making science interesting for people of  all ages, especially young Canadians, is key to fostering innovative thinking  and creating Canada's future science leaders.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Canada's  enthusiasm for science and learning is being recognized on a world scale, and  Natural Resources Canada is proud to have played an important role in this  remarkable achievement,&quot; said the Chief Scientist, Natural Resources  Canada. &quot;Every opportunity to promote the value and excitement of science  is a worthwhile endeavour and should be celebrated.&quot; </p>
&quot;We  are extremely proud that public participation in National Science and  Technology Week was so high as to set a new Guinness World Record,&quot; said Canada  Science and Technology Museums Corporation CEO. &quot;All National Science and  Technology Week partner organizations, as well as the various schools and  venues that took part in the experiments, deserve well-earned congratulations  for their tireless efforts to awaken Canadians of all ages to the wonders of  science. Gathering together nearly 14,000 Canadians doing science at the same  time across the country is a worthy challenge, but it illustrates how much  Canadians are fascinated by science and that is wonderful news.&quot; The Guinness World  Record-setting practical science lesson was coâ€‘ordinated across Canada by  Science.gc.ca, the Government of Canada's official science portal.
