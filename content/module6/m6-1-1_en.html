  <p class="super-special-emphasis">The power to summarize</p>
	<p>&ldquo;The  power to summarize&rdquo; module is intended  to help you better understand what a C-Level summary is so that you can  summarize information more easily in a speech, conversation, meeting or document,  or even summarize your own ideas. </p>
    <p>This  tool will help you incorporate phrases that are used in summaries as well as  learn the rules of indirect speech because you are often required to report  what other people have said when you summarize a situation. The activities will  help improve your listening, reading and writing skills.</p>
    <p>It is suggested that you practise summarizing during  real-life conversations with your co-workers and friends. </p>
