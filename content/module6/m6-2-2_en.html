                        <p>Mario had a meeting with his  supervisor last Thursday for his performance evaluation. As always, it made him  a little nervous. Mario has a unique way of responding when he gets nervous. He  thinks more slowly and gets distracted easily. In short, he loses his wits.  When he woke up the morning of his evaluation, he found that he had set his alarm  for the wrong time and was already 15 minutes behind schedule. So that he  wouldn&rsquo;t be late for work, he decided to drive instead of taking the bus.  Things went downhill from there. </p>
<p>First, there wasn&rsquo;t enough  gas in his car to get him to work, so he had to stop to fill up. Then there was  an accident that was blocking traffic, and only the bus lane was clear. When he  decided to drive in the bus lane, Mario was stopped almost immediately by the  police. At that moment it was clear that he was going to be late for his  evaluation, but he did not have his cell phone on him to call his boss to let  him know.</p>
