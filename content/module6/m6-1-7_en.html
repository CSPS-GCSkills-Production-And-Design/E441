        <dt>Georgette </dt><dd>Hello everyone!Â  You&rsquo;re probably wondering why we&rsquo;re meeting  today. <strong>In a word</strong>, I wanted us to have a meeting this morning to discuss  the new guidelines that we&rsquo;ve received. I&rsquo;m sure everyone has read them  carefully. </dd>
        <dt>Steve </dt><dd>Well, I read them, but  I am not sure about carefully! </dd>
        <dt>Omar </dt><dd>I read them as well,  but I have a number of questions about certain parts which I didn&rsquo;t think were  clear. In my opinion, they were not fully explained.</dd>
        <dt>Lucia </dt><dd>For my part, I only  had enough time to give them a quick once over, <strong>so</strong> I can&rsquo;t really  comment. But I do intend to read them again more carefully before our next  meeting. Anyway, <strong>Georgette told me that</strong> they were not very difficult to  understand.</dd>
        <dt>Georgette </dt><dd>All right. <strong>Basically</strong>,  we&rsquo;ll have new rules which come into force by the end of the fiscal year. <strong>This  means</strong> that our current arrangements will only apply to existing clients who  have a valid contract<strong>. Management has indicated</strong> <strong>that</strong> the new  guidelines would better manage the transition period.</dd>
        <dt>Omar </dt><dd><strong>To be honest</strong>, I would find it more logical to wait for the new  rules before giving us the guidelines. If not, it looks like things are still  up in the air.</dd>
        <dt>Lucia </dt><dd>Georgette, could you  roughly give us the outline?</dd>
        <dt>Georgette </dt><dd><strong>To</strong> quickly <strong>summarize</strong>, all our new clients must  follow the new rules, and our current clients will follow the old rules until  the end of their contracts. In addition, the new rules contain new procedures  for our clients and will change our role in the management of contracts  somewhat. <strong>All that to say that</strong> you will need to familiarize yourselves  with the new format and our new role.</dd>
        <dt>Steve </dt><dd>I think that&rsquo;s clear. <strong>To  sum up</strong>, what I understand is that we need to wait for all the information  before putting this into action. </dd>
