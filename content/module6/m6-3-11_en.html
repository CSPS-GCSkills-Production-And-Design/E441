	<h2>INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE PROGRAM</h2>
    <p>Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), through its  International Humanitarian Assistance Program, aims to save lives, alleviate  suffering and maintain the dignity of those affected by conflicts and natural  disasters by providing appropriate, timely and effective responses.</p>
    <p>More than  90&nbsp;percent of those affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes,  floods, hurricanes, landslides and volcanoes, live in developing countries. The  poverty, high-density populations and environmental degradation affecting most  of the people in these countries make them the most vulnerable to disaster and  least able to help themselves when it happens.</p>
    <p>The complex  humanitarian situations that arise from civil war and conflict, most often characterized  by widespread violence, a breakdown of law and authority, and massive  population movements, also affect the world's poorest countries  disproportionately.</p>
    <p>The primary  responsibility for responding to disasters lies with the government of the affected  country. Usually, the affected communities themselves and their governments  provide a significant first response to emergencies.</p>
    <p>When the needs of  the affected communities exceed the capacity of their government to respond, Canada and  governments around the world provide assistance through an established  international humanitarian response system. This system includes donor countries such as Canada; United Nations organizations such  as the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs,  the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNICEF, and the World Food Programme;  the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement;  and experienced non-governmental humanitarian organizations, including the Canadian Foodgrains Bank.</p>
    <p>Canada&rsquo;s commitment</p>
    <p>Canada is committed to providing  appropriate, timely and effective humanitarian assistance, in line with the principles  and best practices of humanitarian donorship.</p>
    <p>CIDA's primary  response to crises is financial support to organizations that make up the  international humanitarian system. Based on an assessment of needs following a  crisis, these organizations ensure that disaster-affected and conflict-affected  people are physically safe, receive health care and have food, water, and  shelter. </p>
