       <h2>TRADEMARKS</h2>
        
    <p>Success  in the business world depends largely on the message you convey and the image  you project. If people cannot pick you out easily from the crowd, you are  likely to be overlooked in favour of an individual or firm with a stronger  presence.</p>
        <p>A  trademark is what identifies your goods or services in the public mind and  shapes how your products or services are perceived in the marketplace.</p>
        <p>It  is no coincidence that some brand names that dominated the North American  market in the 1920s are still leaders today. The public gravitates toward familiar  names and designs that have become associated with quality and reliability.  This is why companies spend millions of dollars nurturing their corporate  image.</p>
        <p>A  registered trademark is a key way of protecting your corporate identity.  Registration of your trademark provides legal title to intellectual property in  much the same way as a deed gives title to a piece of real estate.</p>
        <p>A trademark is a word (or  words), a design, or a combination of these, used to identify the goods or  services of one person or organization and to distinguish these goods or  services from those of others in the marketplace.</p>
        <p>Trademarks come to represent  not only the actual goods or services, but also the reputation, of the  producer. As such, trademarks constitute valuable intellectual property.</p>
        <p> There are three types of  trademarks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>An <strong>ordinary  mark</strong> consists of a word (or words), a design, or a combination of these,  used to identify the goods or services of one person or organization and to  distinguish these goods or services from those of others in the marketplace.  For example, suppose that you started a courier business, which you chose to  call &ldquo;Giddy-up.&rdquo; You could register these words as a trademark (assuming all  legal requirements were met) in regard to the service that you offer.</p></li>
          <li><p>A <strong>certification mark</strong> is used by an individual or organization and licensed to others for the purpose  of identifying goods or services that meet a defined standard, for example, the  Woolmark design, owned by Woolmark Americas Ltd., for use on clothing and other  goods.</p></li>
          <li><p>A <strong>distinguishing  guise</strong> comprises the shaping of goods or their containers, or a mode of  wrapping or packaging goods, which distinguishes them as being produced by a  specific individual or firm. For example, if you manufactured butterfly-shaped  candy, you could register the butterfly shape as a distinguishing guise.</p></li>
          
        </ul>
