	<h2>GLOBALIZATION AND GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH</h2>
	 
    <p>Societies and economies are becoming increasingly interdependent.  These interactions are propelling capital, labour, resources, goods, services,  technology, ideas and culture around the world. The impacts and opportunities  are staggering. Globalization has already had a profound impact on public  health in Canada.  The vast increase in the volume and speed of trade and travel has brought  significant economic benefits to Canadians, while making available a greater  range of consumer products and foods. But there are challenges as well.</p>
     <p>Over the past 30 years, health in Canada and in other  migrant-receiving nations has been increasingly influenced by human migration.  Migration represents one way in which globalization has meant a greater risk  from infectious disease, increasing both the likelihood of an outbreak and the  speed of its transmission. Keeping pace with the demands of a global economy  has meant greater time pressures for Canadian families, along with a  proliferation of convenience foods and reduced time for physical activity. As  well, globalization has had a major effect in the area of health security, as  the free movement of people and ideas has also facilitated the export of  instability and violence, bringing threats to the health and safety of  Canadians. And while the risk of a health emergency remains low, the impact of  an event, whether natural or man-made, could be catastrophic.</p>
    <p>A strong international public health infrastructure and better  global health are in Canada&rsquo;s  interest, because by reducing the risk of illness elsewhere, we help protect  Canadians against current and emerging public health threats. As well, through  our participation in treaties and agreements, such as the International Health  Regulations, Canada  has specific obligations to meet within the international community. </p>
    <p>By sharing Canadian  expertise and taking a leadership role on behalf of Canada in international  fora, the Public  Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) can help achieve these  goals, in partnership with foreign governments and international organizations.  And as the Government of Canada&rsquo;s central coordinating point for health  security issues, PHAC will continue to build Canada&rsquo;s capacity for a robust and  comprehensive national response in the event of public health emergencies, in  collaboration with other federal departments, other levels of governments and  stakeholders.</p>
