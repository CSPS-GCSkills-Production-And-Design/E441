                            <dt>Alice&nbsp;</dt><dd>Hello Martin. Listen, I’ve seen a course that is offered in the region about how to handle difficult people, and it really interests me. Have you ever heard of it?</dd>
                            <dt>Martin&nbsp;</dt><dd>Yes. In fact, I’ve taken it. It’s very interesting, and I highly recommend it.</dd>
                            <dt>Alice </dt><dd>All in all, what do you remember about it?</dd>
                            <dt>Martin </dt><dd>Well, overall, I remember that everything dealt with how to communicate.</dd>
                            <dt>Alice </dt><dd>So you are saying that you learned different techniques to communicate better with difficult people?</dd>
                            <dt>Martin </dt><dd>Yes, among others. We also practised the techniques by role playing. It was hard, but it was worth it for me.</dd>
                            <dt>Alice </dt><dd>I also saw that they had techniques to help identify the different types of personalities. It should be pretty interesting.</dd>
                            <dt>Martin </dt><dd>That wasn’t covered in the course I took, but I would be interested in knowing how to do that.</dd>
                            <dt>Alice </dt><dd>I’ll let you know. What did you put in your learning plan?</dd>
                            <dt>Martin </dt><dd>Well, I saw a one-day course on trends in technology. It’s not that interesting to me, but it might be useful given our situation at work. They discuss the new platforms that are available, security systems and topics such as social networks. In short, an overview of what is happening in the field right now.</dd>
                            <dt>Alice </dt><dd>Were you aware that the whole team is supposed to have a course on a similar topic?</dd>
                            <dt>Martin </dt><dd>No. What course?</dd>
                            <dt>Alice </dt><dd>We got an e-mail a couple of months ago. Basically, it said an instructor would be brought in to discuss new trends in technology. Would you like me to forward it to you?</dd>
                            <dt>Martin </dt><dd>Yes, of course. I guess I should look at what other courses are available. Thanks for the info.</dd>
