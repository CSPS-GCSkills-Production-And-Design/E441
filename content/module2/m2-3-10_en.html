	<p>To: Ludmila<br>
	  From: Andrea<br>
	  <br>
	  Hello Ludmila,</p>
        <p>I was pleased  to learn that your job is giving you an opportunity to take on new challenges  and that you&rsquo;ll be making a presentation in China. You seem a bit worried and I  can understand why. It&rsquo;s always daunting to present the results of your work,  especially when you have to do so in front of people from a different culture.  It&rsquo;s hard to know how to interpret their reactions during the presentation. But  I know how professional you are, and I&rsquo;m sure all will go smoothly.</p>
        <p>Personally,  when I&rsquo;m preparing for this type of situation, I follow a plan that I&rsquo;ve used  ever since my first professional visit abroad. Here it is. Use it as you see  fit. </p>
        <p>First, you  should visit the Travel Advice section of the Foreign Affairs website. If you  type in your destination, Guangzhou  in your case, you&rsquo;ll find all sorts of recommendations. If I were you, I&rsquo;d pay  special attention to the part about Law and Culture. That way, you&rsquo;ll have  fewer surprises when you arrive. There&rsquo;s also a section on Registration. Make  sure you register so that Canadian authorities will know where you are and can  take effective action in case of an emergency. I for one find that reassuring,  especially when I&rsquo;m travelling alone. </p>
        <p>You could also  look at sites that discuss business etiquette. They often have good  recommendations about what to do, and especially what not to do, in certain  countries. It&rsquo;s the little details that will make a favourable impression on  your hosts, and you&rsquo;ll feel more in control during your stay. In addition, it  wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea to learn a few words of the local language if you have a  chance, like how to say hello and thank you. </p>
        <p>For the  presentation itself, obviously you should follow all of the instructions in  your invitation, but I suggest you practise in front of a few people who do not  know the subject. Ideally, they should be people who know very little about the  government. We sometimes tend to forget that we are using our in-house jargon.  I, myself, tend to overuse acronyms. </p>
        <p>So there you  go. That&rsquo;s all I can think of for now, but contact me if you have questions;  I&rsquo;ll do my best to answer them. </p>
        <p>One last thing.  Do get a picture taken of yourself during the presentation and send it to me. A  picture of your &ldquo;big moment&rdquo; might also be useful for your professional  portfolio.</p>
        <p>Good luck. </p>
