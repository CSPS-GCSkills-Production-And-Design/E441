	<ul>
	<li>
	 Remember that advice can be formulated in two different ways. Sometimes you give on-the-spot advice during a conversation without giving the matter a lot of thought. Other times, you listen very carefully, analyse the situation and then devise a solution based on all aspects of the question.</p>
	</li>
	<li>The expressions you use will be the same in both cases, whether your advice is improvised or carefully thought out. However, in the second case, where your response is more elaborate, you need to be able to relate the different parts of your suggestion and vary the introductory expressions for each part. You should, therefore, practise asking for and giving advice so you will be able to formulate suggestions with ease.	</li>
