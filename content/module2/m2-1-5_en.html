        <dt>David</dt><dd>Hi everyone. Have you all had the chance to explore our website? <strong>What do you</strong> <strong>suggest</strong> we change?</dd>
        <dt>Alima</dt><dd><strong>I think we should</strong> change the interface to make it more user-friendly. It really isn't easy to navigate. <strong>It would be a good idea to</strong> add a little animated guide that helps the users find what they're looking for.</dd>
        <dt>Rodrique</dt><dd>That's a great idea Alima! <strong>If we could</strong> also simplify and streamline the site, it would be great. Right now there's too much information. Having too much information is as bad as having too little.</dd>
        <dt>Nadia</dt><dd><strong>Have you thought</strong> about adding pictures and videos? Users really love those. They're really popular right now, so I think adding some would be a good idea.</dd>
        <dt>David</dt><dd>Okay. Thank you for your suggestions. I have taken note of everything you've said, and I'll see what changes we can implement.</dd>
