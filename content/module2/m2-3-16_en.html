        <h2>A CAREER FAIR</h2>
        
        <p>During a job fair, a  young graduate came to the booth and said he thought it was almost impossible  these days to pass a job interview if you are not already in the federal public  service. He also mentioned that he had just had an unsuccessful interview. He  did not know what to do to improve his performance, and he was a bit demoralized. </p>
        <p>He was told that the  interview is a key component of any job search and that to boost his chances of  success, he should have visited the department&rsquo;s website to find information on  its mission, its mandate, its programs and its services. He should also have analysed  the requirements of the position in order to anticipate questions that might be  asked and prepare answers. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, he should  have thought about his skills, his limitations, his strengths and his  weaknesses, and about what qualified him for that job. It would have been a  good idea to think about the kind of person he is so as to be able to describe  himself. </p>
        <p>Finally, he could have  thought about questions he wanted to ask during the interview. The members of  the selection board would then have realized that he was prepared. </p>
        <p>At the booth, he asked a  number of questions and took note of the answers. At the end of the  conversation, he seemed to be reassured and confident. </p>
