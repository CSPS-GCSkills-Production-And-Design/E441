                         <p>Context <br />During a break, Caroline and Amadeo discuss their points of view about a conference on resilience.</p>
                        <dl class="dialogue">                        
                        <dt>Caroline  </dt><dd>So, what did you think of the conference? Personally, I found the subject of building resilience very interesting and felt the speaker made some good points. </dd>
                        <dt>Amadeo </dt><dd>Really? I’d have to say that I disagree with what the psychologist said. The way I understood it, she felt that living through a tragedy helps us to achieve psychological balance, and that this balance allows us to have good relationships with others.</dd>
                        <dt>Caroline </dt><dd>Yes, that was her point. I’m inclined to agree with her. There are people who have problems taking responsibility and dealing with pressure simply because they’ve never had to do it before.</dd>
                        <dt>Amadeo </dt><dd>Yes, that may be true, but  still . . . . To me the idea that we have to go through a tragedy or crisis in order to be able to reflect seems like a very dubious concept. I think crises cause more harm than good. I know a lot of people who are thoughtful and reflective, but lead very peaceful lives.</dd>
                        <dt>Caroline </dt><dd>Well, I more or less agree with the speaker’s idea. We often see people who haven’t dealt with any real difficulties being arrogant and not really taking other people’s feelings into account. The challenges that we overcome help us become better people by making us understand that we're not as strong as we think and that we can’t control everything.</dd>
                        <dt>Amadeo </dt><dd>Not necessarily. I would say that not everyone who goes through a difficult time comes out of it stronger. I simply cannot agree with the generalization that going through a tragedy makes everyone stronger. In my opinion, we only learn to cope with different kinds of pressure with the passing of time. </dd>
                        <dt>Caroline </dt><dd>Well, I guess we’ll have to agree to disagree. </dd>
