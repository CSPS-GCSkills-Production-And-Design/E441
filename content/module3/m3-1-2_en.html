	<ul>
	<li> An opinion at the C  level is stated clearly. After hearing it, the listener is certain to  understand what the speaker thinks about the topic discussed.</li>
	<li>An  opinion at the C level is well-developed. The speaker considers the context,  illustrates and gives examples, and thinks about counter arguments to the one  presented.</li>
	<li>An  opinion at the C level is nuanced. The speaker can clarify and qualify his or  her thoughts thanks to the mastery of such linguistic elements as adjectives  and adverbs, linking words, and hypothetical forms. Therefore, it is  recommended that the modules &ldquo;Making Comparisons,&rdquo; &ldquo;Giving Advice,&rdquo; &ldquo;Relating Cause and Effect Situations,&rdquo;  &ldquo;Summarizing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Making Hypotheses&rdquo;  be completed prior to completing this module.
