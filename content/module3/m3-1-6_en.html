<p>Question:</p>
<p>In your  opinion, is work-related stress related to the type of work a person does or to  the person who occupies the position? In other words, is a surgeon more likely  to be more stressed than a plumber?</p>
<p>Opinion:</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an  interesting question. <strong>Personally, I  would tend to say</strong> that stress is generally related to the position rather  than to the person who holds the position. <strong>To  me, it&rsquo;s clear</strong> that the job of a surgeon is much more stressful than the  job of a plumber. The lives of the surgeon&rsquo;s patients depend on each decision  he/she makes and there&rsquo;s really no room for error, which is not the case for a  plumber. <strong>I believe</strong> that some jobs  which are very stressful such as surgeons, airline pilots, air traffic  controllers, judges or company directors, don&rsquo;t seem to be because the people  who occupy these positions possess an exceptional capacity to manage their  stress. In fact, <strong>if you ask me</strong>, this  capacity is essential for these professions; otherwise, it would be very  difficult for them to do their jobs effectively.</p>
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s no doubt that  you could find studies</strong> that show that certain administrative assistants are more stressed than their  bosses, and <strong>I&rsquo;m sure that it&rsquo;s possible</strong>.  But in these cases, <strong>I believe</strong> that  stress is not necessarily linked to the duties that the employee must  accomplish, but rather to abnormal work conditions in which their duties are  performed. <strong>In my opinion</strong>, we must be  careful with studies that claim that workplace stress is not at all related to  the job position.</p>
<p>In brief, I&rsquo;m not  saying that there aren&rsquo;t exceptions, but <strong>I&rsquo;m  convinced</strong> that in most cases and under normal conditions, certain jobs are  more demanding and more stressful than others.</p>
