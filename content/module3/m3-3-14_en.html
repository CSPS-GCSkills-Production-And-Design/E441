        <h2>WORKING SAFELY AND SECURELY</h2>
        
        <p>Many people  doubt the effectiveness of security measures in the departments and agencies of  the federal government. </p>
        <p>Increased  terrorist threats around the world and the manifestation of growing violence in  the workplace lead workers to question the effectiveness of the security  measures in place to protect them. Do they have reason for doubt?</p>
    <p>For certain,  the federal government has taken the threats very seriously and paid special  attention to security measures in the different buildings where public servants  work. Therefore, when public servants enter a government building, they must  prove their identity with an identity card issued by security services and  carry this card with them while they are in the building. <br />
          <br />
          However, one  can doubt such measures as terrorist networks have become very organized. There  is a question of whether the security arrangements in place will prevent them  from engaging in acts of terrorism. If they can get fake passports, they can  also obtain identity cards. In fact, such measures protect against petty theft  or minor offenses, but not against terrorist acts. </p>
    <p>Similarly,  such measures can not counter acts of violence that are often the result of  annoyances in the workplace. There is no sure way of predicting human  behaviour. Apart from certain warning signs, a potentially dangerous person has  no specific profile. Violent acts can be committed by an employee, a manager, a  client or a family member. So, despite all the security measures in place,  violence can still occur at work.</p>
        <p>Given the uncertainty  surrounding security, it is hard to believe that it is possible to operate in a  workplace without any threats. </p>
