	<p>To: Jafar<br>
	  From: Christine<br>
	  Subject: Response to your Mini Survey</p>
    <p>Dear Jafar,</p>
    <p>Your survey was  very interesting. Personally, I would say that the ability to communicate  effectively is the most important skill a manager can have. What I think is  that even if managers are good planners who can easily manage a budget, resolve  problems or negotiate agreements, if they cannot communicate, they cannot  really lead because they would have no way to convey their thoughts and  expectations. </p>
    <p>Regarding the  question as to whether it is better to learn to manage through training or  through having a variety of experiences and positions, I would think that  real-world experience counts much more than training. In my opinion, there are  certain delicate situations that managers have to deal with that no amount of  instruction can prepare them for. Without being an expert, I am of the opinion  that living through these experiences is the best way of learning to manage  them. Having gone through these experiences, we learn more from life lessons  than we do from training.   </p>
I hope that my standpoint  on this is useful to you.<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></section>
