	  <p>A good strategy for expanding  your personal vocabulary for expressing cause and effect is to stop using the  most common expressions and to replace them with equivalents.Â  </p>
      <br />      
      <p>Example:</p><p>Force  yourself not to use &ldquo;because,&rdquo; &ldquo;then&rdquo; or &ldquo;so&rdquo; for a while. You will certainly  improve how you express yourself by integrating new, more precise and more  vibrant words.</p></li>
