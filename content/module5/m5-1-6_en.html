    <p>For more than fifty years, various levels of government have been encouraging Canadians to lead healthy lives. Having been told to eat well, be active and manage stress, Canadians as a whole could be expected to be in exceptional health. However, that is not the case.</p>
    <p><strong>Because</strong> an increasingly fast lifestyle imposes career, family and other obligations on us, we eat fast food, which makes us gain weight. <strong>Since</strong> we no longer have the time to exercise regularly, we do not reach our goals in this area either. Finally, the guilt of not having the time to do everything we should be doing to be healthy raises our stress level <strong>so that</strong>, here again, we fail.</p>
    <strong>Consequently</strong>, there is a very simple way to change our lifestyle to improve our health. We need to take the time to review our priorities.Â
