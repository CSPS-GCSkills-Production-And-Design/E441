          <p>Yes, it&rsquo;s true that there was a problem with my project. It started to go badly when we were told that we would lose two employees. Management had to cut positions, and our team was targeted because we had two temporary employees—two good employees who worked hard and contributed a great deal to the project.</p>
          <p>Given that we still needed to complete the project on schedule even though we lost two employees, we asked those who remained to work overtime.  </p>
          <p>However, there was so much overtime to do that within a few weeks, everyone was exhausted. So, we then decided to postpone the deadline. Since we had partners in other departments, we had to convince them that it was unrealistic to aim for the original date. </p>
          <p>At that point, we had a minor crisis on our hands as some of the partners couldn&rsquo;t continue after the original deadline. Consequently, they had to withdraw from the project, and as they were no longer on the team, we had to take back all the components of the project that we thought had been finished and review everyone&rsquo;s roles and responsibilities. </p>
          <p>Everything was going badly, to the point that we thought we were moving backwards instead of forwards. Fortunately, because of all the problems that we encountered, management gave us a lot more time and reviewed the scope of the project. We completed it, but it wasn&rsquo;t easy.</p>
