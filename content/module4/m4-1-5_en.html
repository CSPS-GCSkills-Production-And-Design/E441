	<h3>Reminder:</h3>

    <p>In present unreal conditionals, "were" is used for all persons in the <strong>if</strong>-clause.</p>
    
    <p>Generally the future or past modals are not used in the <strong>if</strong>-clause except when we are making a very polite request or in cases where <strong>if</strong> means "whether."</p>
