<dt>John&nbsp;</dt><dd>Because of the renovations, the problems with space and noise have just been getting worse and worse.</dd>
<dt>Annie&nbsp;</dt><dd>Yeah. The other day, it was impossible to find a room for our team meeting.</dd>
<dt>Francis&nbsp;</dt><dd><strong>Under these conditions</strong>, <strong>it might be</strong> necessary to create a schedule that coordinates those few rooms that are still available </dd>
<dt>John&nbsp;</dt><dd>That's a good idea, but <strong>if</strong> the contractors <strong>start</strong> to work in the room we've reserved, <strong>we are</strong> no better off.</dd>
<dt>Francis&nbsp;</dt><dd><strong>If we decide</strong> to do this, the schedule <strong>will have</strong> <strong>to</strong> take into consideration the proposed schedule for the contractors.</dd>
<dt>Annie&nbsp;</dt><dd><strong>Could</strong> management <strong>keep</strong> us informed of the progress of the work<strong>? If it were possible</strong>, it would solve part of the problem.</dd>
<dt>John&nbsp;</dt><dd><strong>Suppose that</strong> we were able to get management's co-operation, it still wouldn't solve the problem of the noise. <strong>If it gets</strong> any noisier, we <strong>won't be</strong> able to do our jobs anymore.</dd>
<dt>Francis&nbsp;</dt><dd><strong>Assuming that</strong> everyone co-operates, we should be able to find a solution. Some of us could work from home, or we could look into using cubicles in another part of the building.</dd>
<dt>John&nbsp;</dt><dd>It's certainly worth giving it a try.</dd>
<dt>Annie&nbsp;</dt><dd>I agree. <strong>If</strong> IT <strong>has</strong> enough laptops, it <strong>will be</strong> easy to find a temporary workspace.</dd>
